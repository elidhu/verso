# Example Markdown File

This is an example of a Verso / Recto Markdown file with annotations.

Within `example.py` there is an annotated region with the ID `examples/1`. Its contents are:

```
@@examples/1
```

There is also this annotated region with the ID `examples/2`:

```
@@examples/2
```

_Hopefully, that has some content!_

This is an example of a relative path:

@?examples/1.relpath

... and an absolute one:

@?examples/1.abspath
